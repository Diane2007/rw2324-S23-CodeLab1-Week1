# WEEK 1 HOMEWORK: TOUCH DA ELEPHANT 2.0

Remember my build for the Code Lab 0 final project? The touching elephant and giraffe one? I expanded it, adding more elements in it because I love those animals.

Things that I added this time:
1. playing with global variables -- Just so the relationship points with Ellie and Giovanni don't get lost after reloading scenes
2. try touching their butt :)
3. fixing some inconsistencies -- such as you keep getting invited to swim
4. choose your color scene -- because having a default color for your character is problematic (using global variable)




I may expand it further in the future?? Who knows. Maybe adding a dog or a cat or a pig.
